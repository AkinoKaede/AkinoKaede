# 秋のかえで (AkinoKaede)

## About Me

Hi, I am AkinoKaede, a student majoring in Data Science. I love freedom and free software.

### Personality

I am an INTP (***I**ntroverted* *i**N**tuitive* ***T**hinking* ***P**erceiving*). I prefer to work in quiet environments, and I do not like to do things that I am not interested in.

### Programing

I am good at server-side programing using Go, Rust, PHP and Python. I am interested in the Internet communication protocols now.

### Free Software

*Free as in Freedom.* I believe free software is the best way to make developers and users equal, and it could make developers not be evil. I like to use the licenses that published by the Free Software Foundation to license my projects.

### Languages

I can speak Chinese and English. Although English is not my first language, I am trying to speak it better.
